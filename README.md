<h2>Cube Class</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates the usage of a Cube class. The Cube class encapsulates the properties of a cube, including its side length. The program utilizes pointer to member syntax to access and modify the side length of the cube object.

<h4>Installation</h4>
To run this program, you need a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and execute the program using any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later standards.

<h4>Usage</h4>
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Ayushcodespy/Cpp-programs

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source files:
    cd Cpp-programs
   
3. Compile the program using your C++ compiler. For example:
